  return `Given the following PostgreSQL query, query plan & table definitions, suggest only one index improvement that would result in significantly faster query execution. Generally avoid partial indexes unless you're *certain* it will lead to orders-of-magnitude improvements. Think through the query, the query plan, the indexes the plan used, the indexes already present on the tables, and come up with a plan. Then, provide a single code block with all the index proposals together at the end. i.e.:
\u0060\u0060\u0060sql
CREATE INDEX dbpill_index_name_upper ON table_name (column_name1, some_function(column_name2));
\u0060\u0060\u0060

Make sure the suggested index is to improve the provided query specifically, not other hypothetical queries. Pay close attention to the query, and make sure any data transformation in the where clause is also applied to the index declaration.

Always prefix the index name with dbpill_ to avoid conflicts with existing indexes.

Here are some general guidelines for index suggestions:

Index Scan vs. Index Only Scan: If you see many Index Scans where Index Only Scans could be used, it might indicate that you could benefit from including more columns in your index.

Bitmap Heap Scan followed by Bitmap Index Scan: While not necessarily bad, these can sometimes be improved by creating a more specific index.

High-cost Index Scans: If the cost of an Index Scan is unexpectedly high, it might indicate that the index is not selective enough.

Filter operations after Seq Scan or Index Scan: This often indicates that the filter condition could be included in an index.

Large number of rows in Seq Scan: If a Seq Scan is reading a large portion of a big table, an index might help.

Sort operations: If you see expensive sort operations, consider if an index could eliminate the need for sorting.

Hash Join or Merge Join instead of Nested Loop: For join operations, if you're seeing Hash Joins or Merge Joins where you expect Nested Loops, it might indicate missing join indexes.

High-cost Nested Loop operations: Even with Nested Loops, if the cost is high, better indexes might help.

Multiple Index Scans on the same table: This might suggest that a multi-column index could be beneficial.

Parallel operations on smaller tables: If PostgreSQL is using parallel operations on relatively small tables, it might indicate missing indexes.
